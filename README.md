This project was created using React and Bootstrap.

The project was created in order to advertise my father's small desert company which he runs from home.

My intention was to keep the website simple and clean whilst providing the essential information. I used UX/UI techniques such as including a call to action at the bottom of most pages in order to try to direct the customer to get in touch with my father to make a purchase.

This was my first time using Bootstrap and I loved it. In previous projects, for example, my projects website, I had found it incredibly time-consuming to make the site responsive, having to manually adjust the sizing and position of many elements for many screen sizes. Bootstrap makes responsive design easy by using a grid technique. There are 12 horizontal columns with the ability to stack rows. You set the number of columns you would like the element's widths within a row to be and Bootstrap does the rest; adjusting the widths of the elements dependent on the screen size and the number of columns assigned.


In the project directory, you can run 'npm start' which runs the app in the development mode.\
